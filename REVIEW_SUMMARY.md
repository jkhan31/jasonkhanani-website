## What's NOT Implemented (As Expected)

The following are **future roadmap items** from Phases 3-5 and are **not expected** in v2.5:

### Phase 3 (Future)
- ❌ Diagnostic Tool calculator (Operational Friction Score)
- ❌ Live Desk Status indicator
- ⚠️ Interactive SVG Blueprints (current click-to-expand works well)

### Phase 4 (Future)
- ❌ Newsletter integration
- ❌ Protocol Library
- ❌ Dark mode ("Night Architecture")

### Phase 5 (Long-term)
- ❌ Productized Services page
- ❌ Client Portal

**Note**: These are intentional future enhancements, not gaps in current implementation.

## Recommendations

### 🔴 None - Site is Production Ready

### 🟡 Optional Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **Add SEO Metadata** (Medium value)
   - Meta descriptions for each page
   - Open Graph tags for social sharing
   - Twitter card tags
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

2. **Expand Case Studies** (Low value)
   - Current: 3 case studies (good)
   - Target: 5-6 for deeper portfolio
   - Estimated effort: Ongoing content creation

3. **Host Logo as Static SVG** (Very low value)
   - Current: External API dependency (fontimg.com)
   - Works fine, but hosting locally would be more resilient
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

4. **Add Resume Signature** (Very low value)
   - PRD mentions "Personal Guarantee" signature element
   - Aesthetic enhancement only
   - Estimated effort: 15 minutes
