In industrial engineering, we often speak about 'mean time between failures' (MTBF). We measure the stress on physical components, the friction in assembly lines, and the heat generated by overworked servers. However, when it comes to human systems, we tend to ignore these metrics in favor of 'hustle'—which is essentially running a machine at 110% capacity until it seizes.

> **The Thesis**: When a process requires 110% capacity to function, it isn't 'efficient'; it is brittle. It is one unexpected variable away from total collapse.

## The PWA Balance: Brittle vs. Resilient

The Purpose-Wellbeing Axis (PWA) helps us categorize where a system is failing. A system with high purpose but low wellbeing is a 'Burnout Engine.' A system with high wellbeing but low purpose is 'Stagnant.' We aim for the top-right quadrant.

| System Attribute | Brittle (Hustle) | Resilient (Engineered) |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Operational Load | 100-110% consistently | 70-80% with surge capacity |
| Feedback Loops | Delayed (Quarterly) | Instant (SFR Rhythm) |
| Failure Mode | Catastrophic / Total Stop | Graceful Degradation |
| Primary Driver | Extrinsic Pressure | Intrinsic Purpose (PWA) |

## Moving Beyond Hustle Culture

Resilience, in this context, is not about 'bouncing back' after the damage is done; it is about building systems that have the structural integrity to handle the load without breaking in the first place.
