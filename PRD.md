# 📐 Specification & Roadmap: The Jason Kester Hanani Protocol
**Project Status**: Version 2.5 (Stable Deployment)
**Positioning**: Industrial Engineering applied to Remote Operations.
**Core Aesthetic**: Industrial Minimalism / Architectural Forensics.
## 1. Visual Identity & Design System
The site uses a "Rice Paper and Sumi Ink" philosophy—high contrast, tactile textures, and engineering-grade precision.
### Color Palette:
**Rice Paper (#FAF5F0)**: Soft, non-clinical background.
**Sumi Ink (#1A1A1A)**: High-authority typography.
**Hanko Rust (#802B0A)**: Forensic highlights (Investigator Persona).
**Fox Orange (#F07F2E)**: Action/Velocity highlights (Architect Persona).
### Typography:
- **Headings**: Source Serif 4 (Academic/Authoritative).
- **Body**: Inter (Modern/Functional).
- **Signature**: Custom "Motterdam" script (The Personal Guarantee).
### Tactile Elements:
- **bg-noise**: 4% opacity SVG noise for a "printed" feel.
- **bg-grid**: Radial gradient 30px grid representing systemic order.
## 2. Current Functional Architecture
### A. The Personas (The Dual-Track Strategy)
#### The site frames your skills through two distinct roles to maximize market appeal:
- **The Investigator**: Data-heavy, SQL-driven, forensic recovery of lost revenue.
- **The Architect**: Systems-heavy, async-first, workflow automation for **scale.
### B. Core Modules
- **Evidence** Vault**: A **structured "Impact-First**" case study gallery. Unlike typical portfolios, it uses "Direct Impact" counters to anchor the value in currency or time.
- **Flourishing Framework**: An interactive visualization of your proprietary PWA (**Purpose-Wellbeing Axis**) and SFR (**Sustainable Feedback Rhythm**). This establishes you as a thought leader, not just a worker.
- **Decision Rigor** (Writing): A "Block-System" blog supporting tables, callouts, and grayscale-to-color interactive imagery.
- **The Dossier** (Resume): A print-optimized, high-density professional history with an integrated "Operational Stack" (n8n, SQL, Python).
## 3. Technical Implementation
- **Engine**: Next.js 14 with SSG/ISR for optimized performance and SEO.
- **Content Management**: Sanity CMS with PortableText for rich article content.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration for border-widths (0.5px) and tracking.
- **Components**: Modular architecture (Logo, SectionHeader, AxisMarker) for rapid page assembly.
- **Rendering**: Static Site Generation with 60-second Incremental Static Regeneration for automatic content updates.
## 4. The Roadmap: What's Next?
### Phase 3: Interactive Authority **(Short **Term)
- **The "Diagnostic Tool"**: A mini React-based calculator or questionnaire that allows potential clients/employers to input their team size and meeting frequency to estimate **their "Operational Friction Score."**
- **Interactive Blueprints**: Replace static images in the Framework section with interactive SVG diagrams (using Framer Motion) that allow users to toggle between "Brittle" and **"Resilient**" systems.
- **The "Live Desk" Status**: A small header component showing your current "Operational Availability" **(e.g.**, Current Load: 80% | Open for Q2 Audits).
### Phase 4: Expansion **& Lead Gen (Mediu**m Term**)
- **Newsletter "Dispatches"****: An integrated email capture for "The Weekly Audit"—a short, high-value **insight int**o remote ops**.
- **The "Protocol Library"**: A gated section (or public repo) of downloadable Notion templates **or SQL** snippets that help other Ops leaders.
- **Night Architecture **(Dark** Mode**)**: A** highly refined "Deep Sumi" dark **mode for** developers and night-owl hiring managers.
### **Phase 5**: The **Consultancy ****Pivot (Long** Term)
- **Productized Services**: Transitioning the "Evidence" page into a "Services" page **with fixed**-price audits (e.g., "The Revenue Leakage Audit**").
- **Client Portal**: A simplified, password-protected area for active clients to view live forensic dashboards.
## 5. Maintenance Protocols
- **Writing Cadence**: Minimum 1 tactical dispatch every 3 weeks.
- **Evidence Updates**: Quantify any project exceeding €50k in impact immediately.
- **Stack Audit**: Review "The Stack" in the Resume every quarter to ensure n8n/AI toolsets are up to date.
